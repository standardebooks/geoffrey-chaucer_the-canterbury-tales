					<span>The Cook of London, while the Reeve thus spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For joy he laugh’d and clapp’d him on the back:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Aha!” quoth he, “for Christë’s passión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Miller had a sharp conclusión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this argument of herbergage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1362" id="noteref-1362" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well saidë Solomon in his languáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bring thou not every man into thine house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For harbouring by night is periloús.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well ought a man avised for to be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1363" id="noteref-1363" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom that he brought into his privity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God to give me sorrow and care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ever, since I hightë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1364" id="noteref-1364" epub:type="noteref">15</a> Hodge of Ware,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>He had a jape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1366" id="noteref-1366" epub:type="noteref">17</a> of malice in the derk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But God forbid that we should stintë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1367" id="noteref-1367" epub:type="noteref">18</a> here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore if ye will vouchsafe to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tale of me, that am a poorë man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you tell as well as e’er I can</span>

				<p>
					<span>Our Host answér’d and said; “I grant it thee.</span>

					<span>Roger, tell on; and look that it be good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For many a pasty hast thou letten blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a Jack of Dover<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1368" id="noteref-1368" epub:type="noteref">19</a> hast thou sold,</span>

					<span>That had been twicë hot and twicë cold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christë’s curse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of thy parsley yet fare they the worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they have eaten in thy stubble goose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in thy shop doth many a fly go loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now tell on, gentle Roger, by thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet I pray thee be not wroth for game;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1369" id="noteref-1369" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>

					<span>A man may say full sooth in game and play.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou sayst full sooth,” quoth Roger, “by my fay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth play quad play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1370" id="noteref-1370" epub:type="noteref">21</a> as the Fleming saith,</span>

					<span>And therefore, Harry Bailly, by thy faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be thou not wroth, else we departë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1371" id="noteref-1371" epub:type="noteref">22</a> here,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A prentice whilom dwelt in our city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of a craft of victuallers was he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Galliard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1375" id="noteref-1375" epub:type="noteref">26</a> he was, as goldfinch in the shaw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1376" id="noteref-1376" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brown as a berry, a proper short felláw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lockës black, combed full fetisly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1377" id="noteref-1377" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dance he could so well and jollily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was called Perkin Revellour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was as full of love and paramour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is the honeycomb of honey sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was the wenchë that with him might meet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every bridal would he sing and hop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He better lov’d the tavern than the shop.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when there any riding was in Cheap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1378" id="noteref-1378" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the shoppë thither would he leap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, till that he had all the sight y-seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And danced well, he would not come again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gather’d him a meinie of his sort,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1379" id="noteref-1379" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hop and sing, and makë such disport:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there they settë steven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1380" id="noteref-1380" epub:type="noteref">31</a> for to meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To playen at the dice in such a street.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in the townë was there no prentíce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fairer couldë cast a pair of dice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than Perkin could; and thereto he was free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his dispence, in place of privity.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1381" id="noteref-1381" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That found his master well in his chaffare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1382" id="noteref-1382" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oftentime he found his box full bare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, soothëly, a prentice revelloúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That haunteth dice, riot, and paramoúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master shall it in his shop abie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1383" id="noteref-1383" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1384" id="noteref-1384" epub:type="noteref">2</a> have he no part of the minstrelsy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For theft and riot they be convertible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1385" id="noteref-1385" epub:type="noteref">2</a> can they play on gitern or ribible.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1386" id="noteref-1386" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revel and truth, as in a low degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be full wroth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1387" id="noteref-1387" epub:type="noteref">4</a> all day, as men may see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This jolly prentice with his master bode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he was nigh out of his prenticehood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1388" id="noteref-1388" epub:type="noteref">2</a> were he snubbed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1389" id="noteref-1389" epub:type="noteref">5</a> both early and late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes led with revel to Newgate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last his master him bethought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a day when he his paper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1390" id="noteref-1390" epub:type="noteref">6</a> sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a proverb, that saith this samë word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better is rotten apple out of hoard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that it should rot all the remenánt:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fares it by a riotous servánt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is well lessë harm to let him pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1391" id="noteref-1391" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than he shend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1392" id="noteref-1392" epub:type="noteref">8</a> all the servants in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore his master gave him a quittánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade him go, with sorrow and mischance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus this jolly prentice had his leve:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1393" id="noteref-1393" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let him riot all the night, or leave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1394" id="noteref-1394" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, for there is no thief without a louke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1395" id="noteref-1395" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That helpeth him to wasten and to souk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1396" id="noteref-1396" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that he bribë can, or borrow may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon he sent his bed and his array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a compere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1397" id="noteref-1397" epub:type="noteref">13</a> of his owen sort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved dice, and riot, and disport;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had a wife, that held for countenance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1398" id="noteref-1398" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shop, and swived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1399" id="noteref-1399" epub:type="noteref">15</a> for her sustenance.</span>

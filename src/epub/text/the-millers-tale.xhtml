				<p>
					<span>When that the Knight had thus his talë told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the rout was neither young nor old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he not said it was a noble story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worthy to be drawen to memóry;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-907" id="noteref-907" epub:type="noteref">907</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namëly the gentles every one.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-908" id="noteref-908" epub:type="noteref">908</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host then laugh’d and swore, “So may I gon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-909" id="noteref-909" epub:type="noteref">909</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This goes aright; unbuckled is the mail;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-910" id="noteref-910" epub:type="noteref">910</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let see now who shall tell another tale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truëly this game is well begun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now telleth ye, Sir Monk, if that ye conne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-911" id="noteref-911" epub:type="noteref">911</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Somewhat, to quiten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-912" id="noteref-912" epub:type="noteref">912</a> with the Knightë’s tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Miller that fordrunken was all pale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-913" id="noteref-913" epub:type="noteref">913</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that unnethes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-914" id="noteref-914" epub:type="noteref">914</a> upon his horse he sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would avalen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-915" id="noteref-915" epub:type="noteref">915</a> neither hood nor hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor abide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-916" id="noteref-916" epub:type="noteref">916</a> no man for his courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in Pilatë’s voice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-917" id="noteref-917" epub:type="noteref">917</a> he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore by armës, and by blood, and bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I can a noble talë for the nones,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-918" id="noteref-918" epub:type="noteref">918</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which I will now quite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-919" id="noteref-919" epub:type="noteref">919</a> the Knightë’s tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host saw well how drunk he was of ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Robin, abide, my levë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-920" id="noteref-920" epub:type="noteref">920</a> brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some better man shall tell us first another:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abide, and let us workë thriftily.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-921" id="noteref-921" epub:type="noteref">921</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By Goddë’s soul,” quoth he, “that will not I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will speak, or ellës go my way!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answer’d; “Tell on a devil way;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-922" id="noteref-922" epub:type="noteref">922</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now hearken,” quoth the Miller, “all and some:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first I make a protestatioún.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I am drunk, I know it by my soun’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore if that I misspeak or say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-923" id="noteref-923" epub:type="noteref">923</a> it the ale of Southwark, I you pray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will tell a legend and a life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of a carpenter and of his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that a clerk hath set the wrightë’s cap.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-924" id="noteref-924" epub:type="noteref">924</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Reeve answér’d and saidë, “Stint thy clap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-925" id="noteref-925" epub:type="noteref">925</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let be thy lewëd drunken harlotry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is a sin, and eke a great folly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To apeiren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-926" id="noteref-926" epub:type="noteref">926</a> any man, or him defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke to bringë wives in evil name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou may’st enough of other thingës sayn.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This drunken Miller spake full soon again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë, “Levë brother Osëwold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hath no wifë, he is no cuckóld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I say not therefore that thou art one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There be full goodë wivës many one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why art thou angry with my talë now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have a wife, pardie, as well as thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet n’old<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-927" id="noteref-927" epub:type="noteref">927</a> I, for the oxen in my plough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taken upon me morë than enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To deemen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-928" id="noteref-928" epub:type="noteref">928</a> of myself that I am one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will believë well that I am none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An husband should not be inquisitive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Goddë’s privity, nor of his wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he may findë Goddë’s foison<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-929" id="noteref-929" epub:type="noteref">929</a> there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the remnant needeth not to enquére.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What should I more say, but that this Millére</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would his wordës for no man forbear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But told his churlish<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-930" id="noteref-930" epub:type="noteref">930</a> tale in his mannére;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thinketh, that I shall rehearse it here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore every gentle wight I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Goddë’s love to deem not that I say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of evil intent, but that I must rehearse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their tales all, be they better or worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ellës falsen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-931" id="noteref-931" epub:type="noteref">931</a> some of my mattere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore whoso list it not to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn o’er the leaf, and choose another tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he shall find enough, both great and smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of storial<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-932" id="noteref-932" epub:type="noteref">932</a> thing that toucheth gentiless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke morality and holiness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blame not me, if that ye choose amiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Miller is a churl, ye know well this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was the Reeve, with many other mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And harlotry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-933" id="noteref-933" epub:type="noteref">933</a> they toldë bothë two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Avise you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-934" id="noteref-934" epub:type="noteref">934</a> now, and put me out of blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke men should not make earnest of game.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-935" id="noteref-935" epub:type="noteref">935</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>Whilom there was dwelling in Oxenford</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A richë gnof,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-936" id="noteref-936" epub:type="noteref">936</a> that guestës held to board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-937" id="noteref-937" epub:type="noteref">937</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his craft he was a carpentér.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him there was dwelling a poor scholér,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had learned art, but all his fantasy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was turned for to learn astrology.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coudë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-938" id="noteref-938" epub:type="noteref">938</a> a certain of conclusions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To deemë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-939" id="noteref-939" epub:type="noteref">939</a> by interrogations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that men asked him in certain hours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that men should have drought or ellës show’rs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if men asked him what shouldë fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of everything, I may not reckon all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This clerk was called Hendy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-940" id="noteref-940" epub:type="noteref">940</a> Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dernë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-941" id="noteref-941" epub:type="noteref">941</a> love he knew and of solace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewith he was sly and full privy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like a maiden meekë for to see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A chamber had he in that hostelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone, withouten any company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fetisly y-dight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-942" id="noteref-942" epub:type="noteref">942</a> with herbës swoot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-943" id="noteref-943" epub:type="noteref">943</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he himself was sweet as is the root</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of liquorice, or any setewall.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-944" id="noteref-944" epub:type="noteref">944</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Almagest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-945" id="noteref-945" epub:type="noteref">945</a> and bookës great and small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His astrolabe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-946" id="noteref-946" epub:type="noteref">946</a> belonging to his art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His augrim stonës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-947" id="noteref-947" epub:type="noteref">947</a> layed fair apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On shelvës couched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-948" id="noteref-948" epub:type="noteref">948</a> at his beddë’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His press y-cover’d with a falding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-949" id="noteref-949" epub:type="noteref">949</a> red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all above there lay a gay psalt’ry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he made at nightës melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweetëly, that all the chamber rang:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And <i xml:lang="la">Angelus ad virginem</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-950" id="noteref-950" epub:type="noteref">950</a> he sang.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that he sung the kingë’s note;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full often blessed was his merry throat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus this sweetë clerk his timë spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his friendës finding and his rent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-951" id="noteref-951" epub:type="noteref">951</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter had wedded new a wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that he loved morë than his life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of eighteen year, I guess, she was of age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jealous he was, and held her narr’w in cage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was wild and young, and he was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deemed himself bélike<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-952" id="noteref-952" epub:type="noteref">952</a> a cuckóld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew not Cato,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-953" id="noteref-953" epub:type="noteref">953</a> for his wit was rude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bade a man wed his similitude.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men shouldë wedden after their estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For youth and eld<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-954" id="noteref-954" epub:type="noteref">954</a> are often at debate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since that he was fallen in the snare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must endure (as other folk) his care.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fair was this youngë wife, and therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any weasel her body gent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-955" id="noteref-955" epub:type="noteref">955</a> and small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A seint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-956" id="noteref-956" epub:type="noteref">956</a> she weared, barred all of silk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A barm-cloth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-957" id="noteref-957" epub:type="noteref">957</a> eke as white as morning milk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her lendës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-958" id="noteref-958" epub:type="noteref">958</a> full of many a gore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-959" id="noteref-959" epub:type="noteref">959</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>White was her smock,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-960" id="noteref-960" epub:type="noteref">960</a> and broider’d all before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke behind, on her collar about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of coal-black silk, within and eke without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tapës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-961" id="noteref-961" epub:type="noteref">961</a> of her whitë volupere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-962" id="noteref-962" epub:type="noteref">962</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were of the samë suit of her collére;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her fillet broad of silk, and set full high:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-963" id="noteref-963" epub:type="noteref">963</a> she had a likerous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-964" id="noteref-964" epub:type="noteref">964</a> eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full small y-pulled were her browës two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they were bent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-965" id="noteref-965" epub:type="noteref">965</a> and black as any sloe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was well more blissful on to see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-966" id="noteref-966" epub:type="noteref">966</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is the newë perjenetë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-967" id="noteref-967" epub:type="noteref">967</a> tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And softer than the wool is of a wether.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tassel’d with silk, and pearlëd with latoun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-968" id="noteref-968" epub:type="noteref">968</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all this world to seeken up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man so wise, that coudë thenche<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-969" id="noteref-969" epub:type="noteref">969</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So gay a popelot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-970" id="noteref-970" epub:type="noteref">970</a> or such a wench.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full brighter was the shining of her hue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than in the Tower the noble<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-971" id="noteref-971" epub:type="noteref">971</a> forged new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of her song, it was as loud and yern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-972" id="noteref-972" epub:type="noteref">972</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any swallow chittering on a bern.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-973" id="noteref-973" epub:type="noteref">973</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-974" id="noteref-974" epub:type="noteref">974</a> she couldë skip, and make a game,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-975" id="noteref-975" epub:type="noteref">975</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any kid or calf following his dame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her mouth was sweet as braket,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-976" id="noteref-976" epub:type="noteref">976</a> or as methe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-977" id="noteref-977" epub:type="noteref">977</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or hoard of apples, laid in hay or heath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wincing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-978" id="noteref-978" epub:type="noteref">978</a> she was as is a jolly colt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A brooch she bare upon her low collére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As broad as is the boss of a bucklére.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her shoon were laced on her leggës high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was a primerole,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-979" id="noteref-979" epub:type="noteref">979</a> a piggesnie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-980" id="noteref-980" epub:type="noteref">980</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any lord t’ have ligging<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-981" id="noteref-981" epub:type="noteref">981</a> in his bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, sir, and eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-982" id="noteref-982" epub:type="noteref">982</a> sir, so befell the case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on a day this Hendy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-983" id="noteref-983" epub:type="noteref">983</a> Nicholas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell with this youngë wife to rage and play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-984" id="noteref-984" epub:type="noteref">984</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While that her husband was at Oseney,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-985" id="noteref-985" epub:type="noteref">985</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As clerkës be full subtle and full quaint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he caught her by the queint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-986" id="noteref-986" epub:type="noteref">986</a> but if I have my will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For dernë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-987" id="noteref-987" epub:type="noteref">987</a> love of thee, leman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-988" id="noteref-988" epub:type="noteref">988</a> I spill.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-989" id="noteref-989" epub:type="noteref">989</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heldë her fast by the haunchë bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë “Leman, love me well at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I will dien, all so God me save.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she sprang as a colt doth in the trave:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-990" id="noteref-990" epub:type="noteref">990</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with her head she writhed fast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I will not kiss thee, by my fay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-991" id="noteref-991" epub:type="noteref">991</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why let be,” quoth she, “let be, Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or I will cry out harow and alas!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-992" id="noteref-992" epub:type="noteref">992</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do away your handës, for your courtesy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas gan mercy for to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spake so fair, and proffer’d him so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she her love him granted at the last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore her oath by Saint Thomas of Kent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she would be at his commandement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that she may her leisure well espy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My husband is so full of jealousy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-993" id="noteref-993" epub:type="noteref">993</a> ye waitë well, and be privy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot right well I am but dead,” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye mustë be full derne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-994" id="noteref-994" epub:type="noteref">994</a> as in this case.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, thereof care thee nought,” quoth Nicholas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A clerk had litherly beset his while,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-995" id="noteref-995" epub:type="noteref">995</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-996" id="noteref-996" epub:type="noteref">996</a> he could a carpenter beguile.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus they were accorded and y-sworn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wait a time, as I have said beforn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Nicholas had done thus every deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-997" id="noteref-997" epub:type="noteref">997</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thwacked her about the lendës well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He kiss’d her sweet, and taketh his psalt’ry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And playeth fast, and maketh melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then fell it thus, that to the parish church,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Christë’s owen workës for to wirch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-998" id="noteref-998" epub:type="noteref">998</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This good wife went upon a holy day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her forehead shone as bright as any day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was it washen, when she left her werk.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now was there of that church a parish clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which that was y-cleped Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curl’d was his hair, and as the gold it shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strutted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-999" id="noteref-999" epub:type="noteref">999</a> as a fannë large and broad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full straight and even lay his jolly shode.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1000" id="noteref-1000" epub:type="noteref">1000</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His rode<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1001" id="noteref-1001" epub:type="noteref">1001</a> was red, his eyen grey as goose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Paulë’s windows carven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1002" id="noteref-1002" epub:type="noteref">1002</a> on his shoes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hosen red he went full fetisly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1003" id="noteref-1003" epub:type="noteref">1003</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-clad he was full small and properly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All in a kirtle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1004" id="noteref-1004" epub:type="noteref">1004</a> of a light waget;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1005" id="noteref-1005" epub:type="noteref">1005</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fair and thickë be the pointës set.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon he had a gay surplíce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As white as is the blossom on the rise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1006" id="noteref-1006" epub:type="noteref">1006</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A merry child he was, so God me save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well could he letten blood, and clip, and shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make a charter of land, and a quittance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In twenty manners could he trip and dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the school of Oxenfordë tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1007" id="noteref-1007" epub:type="noteref">1007</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his leggës castë to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And playen songës on a small ribible;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1008" id="noteref-1008" epub:type="noteref">1008</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1009" id="noteref-1009" epub:type="noteref">1009</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as well could he play on a gitérn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1010" id="noteref-1010" epub:type="noteref">1010</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the town was brewhouse nor tavérn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he not visited with his solas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1011" id="noteref-1011" epub:type="noteref">1011</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as that any garnard tapstere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1012" id="noteref-1012" epub:type="noteref">1012</a> was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth to say he was somedeal squaimous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1013" id="noteref-1013" epub:type="noteref">1013</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of farting, and of speechë dangerous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Absolon, that jolly was and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went with a censer on the holy day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Censing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1014" id="noteref-1014" epub:type="noteref">1014</a> the wivës of the parish fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a lovely look he on them cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namëly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1015" id="noteref-1015" epub:type="noteref">1015</a> on this carpénter’s wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To look on her him thought a merry life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was so proper, and sweet, and likerous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he a cat, he would her hent anon.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1016" id="noteref-1016" epub:type="noteref">1016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This parish clerk, this jolly Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath in his heartë such a love-longing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of no wife took he none offering;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For courtesy he said he wouldë none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moon at night full clear and brightë shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon his gitern hath y-taken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For paramours he thoughtë for to waken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went, jolif<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1017" id="noteref-1017" epub:type="noteref">1017</a> and amorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he came to the carpentérë’s house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little after the cock had y-crow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dressed him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1018" id="noteref-1018" epub:type="noteref">1018</a> under a shot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1019" id="noteref-1019" epub:type="noteref">1019</a> window,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was upon the carpentérë’s wall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He singeth in his voice gentle and small;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>Now, dear lady, if thy will be,</em></span>
					<br/>
					<span><em>I pray that ye will rue<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1020" id="noteref-1020" epub:type="noteref">1020</a> on me;</em>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full well accordant to his giterning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spake unto his wife, and said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, Alison, hear’st thou not Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That chanteth thus under our bower<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1021" id="noteref-1021" epub:type="noteref">1021</a> wall?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she answer’d her husband therewithal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes, God wot, John, I hear him every deal.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This passeth forth; what will ye bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1022" id="noteref-1022" epub:type="noteref">1022</a> than well?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day this jolly Absolon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wooeth her, that him is woebegone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He waketh all the night, and all the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To comb his lockës broad, and make him gay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wooeth her by means and by brocage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1023" id="noteref-1023" epub:type="noteref">1023</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore he wouldë be her owen page.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He singeth brokking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1024" id="noteref-1024" epub:type="noteref">1024</a> as a nightingale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent her piment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1025" id="noteref-1025" epub:type="noteref">1025</a> mead, and spiced ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wafers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1026" id="noteref-1026" epub:type="noteref">1026</a> piping hot out of the glede:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1027" id="noteref-1027" epub:type="noteref">1027</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for she was of town, he proffer’d meed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1028" id="noteref-1028" epub:type="noteref">1028</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For some folk will be wonnen for richéss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some for strokes, and some with gentiless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes, to show his lightness and mast’ry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He playeth Herod<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1029" id="noteref-1029" epub:type="noteref">1029</a> on a scaffold high.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what availeth him as in this case?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So loveth she the Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Absolon may blow the buckë’s horn:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1030" id="noteref-1030" epub:type="noteref">1030</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had for all his labour but a scorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus she maketh Absolon her ape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his earnest turneth to a jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1031" id="noteref-1031" epub:type="noteref">1031</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full sooth is this provérb, it is no lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men say right thus alway; the nighë sly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maketh oft time the far lief to be loth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1032" id="noteref-1032" epub:type="noteref">1032</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though that Absolon be wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1033" id="noteref-1033" epub:type="noteref">1033</a> or wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that he far was from her sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This nigh Nicholas stood still in his light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now bear thee well, thou Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Absolon may wail and sing “Alas!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that on a Saturday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter was gone to Oseney,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Hendy Nicholas and Alisón</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accorded were to this conclusión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Nicholas shall shapë him a wile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1034" id="noteref-1034" epub:type="noteref">1034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silly jealous husband to beguile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if so were the gamë went aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shouldë sleepen in his arms all night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this was her desire and his also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon, withoutë wordës mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas no longer would he tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But doth full soft unto his chamber carry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both meat and drinkë for a day or tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her husband bade her for to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that he asked after Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shouldë say, “She wist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1035" id="noteref-1035" epub:type="noteref">1035</a> not where he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the day she saw him not with eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She trowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1036" id="noteref-1036" epub:type="noteref">1036</a> he was in some maladý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no cry that her maiden could him call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would answer, for nought that might befall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus passed forth all thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1037" id="noteref-1037" epub:type="noteref">1037</a> Saturday,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ate, and slept, and diddë what him list</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Sunday, that the sunnë went to rest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1038" id="noteref-1038" epub:type="noteref">1038</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly carpenter had great marvail<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1039" id="noteref-1039" epub:type="noteref">1039</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Nicholas, or what thing might him ail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I am adrad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1040" id="noteref-1040" epub:type="noteref">1040</a> by Saint Thomas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It standeth not aright with Nicholas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God shieldë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1041" id="noteref-1041" epub:type="noteref">1041</a> that he died suddenly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world is now full tickle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1042" id="noteref-1042" epub:type="noteref">1042</a> sickerly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1043" id="noteref-1043" epub:type="noteref">1043</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw to-day a corpse y-borne to chirch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That now on Monday last I saw him wirch.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1044" id="noteref-1044" epub:type="noteref">1044</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go up,” quod he unto his knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1045" id="noteref-1045" epub:type="noteref">1045</a> “anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clepe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1046" id="noteref-1046" epub:type="noteref">1046</a> at his door, or knockë with a stone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look how it is, and tell me boldëly.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knavë went him up full sturdily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, at the chamber door while that he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried and knocked as that he were wood:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1047" id="noteref-1047" epub:type="noteref">1047</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What how? what do ye, Master Nicholay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How may ye sleepen all the longë day?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all for nought, he heardë not a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hole he found full low upon the board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1048" id="noteref-1048" epub:type="noteref">1048</a> the cat was wont in for to creep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that hole he looked in full deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last he had of him a sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas sat ever gaping upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he had kyked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1049" id="noteref-1049" epub:type="noteref">1049</a> on the newë moon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown he went, and told his master soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In what array he saw this ilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1050" id="noteref-1050" epub:type="noteref">1050</a> man.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter to blissen him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1051" id="noteref-1051" epub:type="noteref">1051</a> began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Now help us, Saintë Frideswide.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1052" id="noteref-1052" epub:type="noteref">1052</a></span>

					<span>Into some woodness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1054" id="noteref-1054" epub:type="noteref">1054</a> or some agony.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought aye well how that it shouldë be.</span>

					<span>So far’d another clerk with astrónomý:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He walked in the fieldës for to pry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1058" id="noteref-1058" epub:type="noteref">1058</a> the starrës, what there should befall,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He saw not that. But yet, by Saint Thomas!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>While that thou, Robin, heavest off the door:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall out of his studying, as I guess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the chamber door he gan him dress.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1063" id="noteref-1063" epub:type="noteref">1063</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His knavë was a strong carl for the nonce,</span>

					<span>And by the hasp<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1064" id="noteref-1064" epub:type="noteref">1064</a> he heav’d it off at once;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the floor the door fell down anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas sat aye as still as stone,</span>

					<span>And ever he gap’d upward into the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carpenter ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1065" id="noteref-1065" epub:type="noteref">1065</a> he were in despair,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter answér’d; “What sayest thou?</span>

					<span>What? think on God, as we do, men that swink.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1074" id="noteref-1074" epub:type="noteref">1074</a></span>

					<span>This Nicholas answer’d; “Fetch me a drink;</span>

					<span>Of certain thing that toucheth thee and me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will tell it no other man certain.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter went down, and came again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brought of mighty ale a largë quart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that each of them had drunk his part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas his chamber door fast shet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1075" id="noteref-1075" epub:type="noteref">1075</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down the carpentér by him he set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë; “John, mine host full lief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1076" id="noteref-1076" epub:type="noteref">1076</a> and dear,</span>

					<span>Thou shalt upon thy truthë swear me here,</span>

					<span>“Nay, Christ forbid it for his holy blood!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth then this silly man; “I am no blab,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1081" id="noteref-1081" epub:type="noteref">1081</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>“Now, John,” quoth Nicholas, “I will not lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have y-found in my astrology,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have looked in the moonë bright,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>That never half so great was Noë’s flood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This world,” he said, “in less than half an hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall all be dreint,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1085" id="noteref-1085" epub:type="noteref">1085</a> so hideous is the shower:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter answér’d; “Alas, my wife!</span>

					<span>And shall she drench? alas, mine Alisoún!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sorrow of this he fell almost adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Is there no remedy in this case?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why, yes, for God,” quoth Hendy Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou wilt worken after lore and rede;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1087" id="noteref-1087" epub:type="noteref">1087</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou may’st not worken after thine own head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thus saith Solomon, that was full true:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work all by counsel, and thou shalt not rue.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1088" id="noteref-1088" epub:type="noteref">1088</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Hast thou not heard,” quoth Nicholas, “also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrow of Noë, with his fellowship,</span>

					<span>But for one day; fie on the remenant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water shall aslake<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1096" id="noteref-1096" epub:type="noteref">1096</a> and go away</span>

					<span>Nor eke thy maiden Gill I may not save:</span>

					<span>I will not tellë Goddë’s privity.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thy wife shall I well saven out of doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go now thy way, and speed thee hereabout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when thou hast for her, and thee, and me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-gotten us these kneading tubbës three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shalt thou hang them in the roof full high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that no man our purveyance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1100" id="noteref-1100" epub:type="noteref">1100</a> espy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when thou hast done thus as I have said,</span>

					<span>And hast our vitaille fair in them y-laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke an axe to smite the cord in two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the water comes, that we may go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And break an hole on high upon the gable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the garden-ward, over the stable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may freely passë forth our way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the greatë shower is gone away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shalt thou swim as merry, I undertake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the whitë duck after her drake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I clepe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1101" id="noteref-1101" epub:type="noteref">1101</a> ‘How, Alison? How, John?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be merry: for the flood will pass anon.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou wilt say, ‘Hail, Master Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good-morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then shall we be lordës all our life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the world, as Noë and his wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of one thing I warnë thee full right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be well advised, on that ilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1102" id="noteref-1102" epub:type="noteref">1102</a> night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we be enter’d into shippë’s board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none of us not speak a single word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor clepe nor cry, but be in his prayére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that is Goddë’s owen hestë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1103" id="noteref-1103" epub:type="noteref">1103</a> dear.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>For that betwixtë you shall be no sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more in looking than there shall in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This ordinance is said: go, God thee speed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To-morrow night, when men be all asleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into our kneading tubbës will we creep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sittë there, abiding Goddë’s grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go now thy way, I have no longer space</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make of this no longer sermoníng:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men say thus: Send the wise, and say nothing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art so wise, it needeth thee nought teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, save our lives, and that I thee beseech.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This silly carpenter went forth his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft he said, “Alas! and Well-a-day!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his wife he told his privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she was ware, and better knew than he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What all this quaintë cast was for to say.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1105" id="noteref-1105" epub:type="noteref">1105</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Alas! go forth thy way anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help us to scape, or we be dead each one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thy true and very wedded wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, dearë spouse, and help to save our life.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, what a great thing is affectión!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may die of imaginatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So deeply may impressión be take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly carpenter begins to quake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thinketh verily that he may see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This newë flood come weltering as the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To drenchen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1107" id="noteref-1107" epub:type="noteref">1107</a> Alison, his honey dear.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He sigheth, with full many a sorry sough.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1109" id="noteref-1109" epub:type="noteref">1109</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He go’th, and getteth him a kneading trough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that a tub, and a kemelin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he sent them to his inn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hung them in the roof full privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his own hand then made he ladders three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To climbë by the ranges and the stalks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1110" id="noteref-1110" epub:type="noteref">1110</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the tubbës hanging in the balks;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1111" id="noteref-1111" epub:type="noteref">1111</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And victualed them, kemelin, trough, and tub,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With bread and cheese, and good ale in a jub,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1112" id="noteref-1112" epub:type="noteref">1112</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sufficing right enough as for a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere that he had made all this array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent his knave, and eke his wench<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1113" id="noteref-1113" epub:type="noteref">1113</a> also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his need<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1114" id="noteref-1114" epub:type="noteref">1114</a> to London for to go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the Monday, when it drew to night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shut his door withoutë candle light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dressed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1115" id="noteref-1115" epub:type="noteref">1115</a> every thing as it should be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shortly up they climbed all the three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They sattë stillë well a furlong way.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1116" id="noteref-1116" epub:type="noteref">1116</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, <i xml:lang="la">Pater noster</i>, clum,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1117" id="noteref-1117" epub:type="noteref">1117</a> said Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “clum,” quoth John; and “clum,” said Alison:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This carpenter said his devotión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still he sat and bidded his prayére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awaking on the rain, if he it hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deadë sleep, for weary business,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell on this carpenter, right as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the curfew-time,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1118" id="noteref-1118" epub:type="noteref">1118</a> or little more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For travail of his ghost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1119" id="noteref-1119" epub:type="noteref">1119</a> he groaned sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eft he routed, for his head mislay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1120" id="noteref-1120" epub:type="noteref">1120</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown the ladder stalked Nicholay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Alison full soft adown she sped.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoutë wordës more they went to bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1121" id="noteref-1121" epub:type="noteref">1121</a> the carpenter was wont to lie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was the revel, and the melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus lay Alison and Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In business of mirth and in solace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the bell of <i xml:lang="la">laudes</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1122" id="noteref-1122" epub:type="noteref">1122</a> gan to ring,</span>

				<p>
					<span>This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is for love alway so woebegone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Monday was at Oseney</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With company, him to disport and play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked upon cas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1123" id="noteref-1123" epub:type="noteref">1123</a> a cloisterer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1124" id="noteref-1124" epub:type="noteref">1124</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily after John the carpenter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he drew him apart out of the church,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “I n’ot;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1125" id="noteref-1125" epub:type="noteref">1125</a> I saw him not here wirch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1126" id="noteref-1126" epub:type="noteref">1126</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since Saturday; I trow that he be went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For timber, where our abbot hath him sent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he is wont for timber for to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dwellen at the Grange a day or two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else he is at his own house certain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where that he be, I cannot soothly sayn.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1127" id="noteref-1127" epub:type="noteref">1127</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon full jolly was and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “Now is the time to wake all night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1128" id="noteref-1128" epub:type="noteref">1128</a> I saw him not stirríng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his door, since day began to spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may I thrive, but I shall at cock crow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily go knock at his windów,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That stands full low upon his bower wall:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1129" id="noteref-1129" epub:type="noteref">1129</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Alison then will I tellen all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lovë-longing; for I shall not miss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the leastë way I shall her kiss.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>My mouth hath itched all this livelong day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is a sign of kissing at the least.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All night I mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1131" id="noteref-1131" epub:type="noteref">1131</a> eke I was at a feast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I will go sleep an hour or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the night then will I wake and play.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the first cock crowed had, anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up rose this jolly lover Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him arrayed gay, at point devise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1132" id="noteref-1132" epub:type="noteref">1132</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first he chewed grains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1133" id="noteref-1133" epub:type="noteref">1133</a> and liquorice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To smellë sweet, ere he had combed his hair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his tongue a truë love<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1134" id="noteref-1134" epub:type="noteref">1134</a> he bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thereby thought he to be gracious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came he to the carpentérë’s house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still he stood under the shot window;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his breast it raught,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1135" id="noteref-1135" epub:type="noteref">1135</a> it was so low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And soft he coughed with a semisoún’.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1136" id="noteref-1136" epub:type="noteref">1136</a></span>

					<span>No wonder is that I do swelt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1140" id="noteref-1140" epub:type="noteref">1140</a> and sweat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mourn as doth a lamb after the teat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1141" id="noteref-1141" epub:type="noteref">1141</a> leman, I have such love-longíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a turtle true is my mourníng.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not eat, no morë than a maid.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go from the window, thou jack fool,” she said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“As help me God, it will not be, come ba me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1142" id="noteref-1142" epub:type="noteref">1142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I love another, else I were to blamë,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let me sleep; a twenty devil way.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1143" id="noteref-1143" epub:type="noteref">1143</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth Absolon, “and well away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That true love ever was so ill beset:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then kiss me, since that it may be no bet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1144" id="noteref-1144" epub:type="noteref">1144</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Jesus’ love, and for the love of me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Wilt thou then go thy way therewith?” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, certes, leman,” quoth this Absolon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Then make thee ready,” quoth she, “I come anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>[And unto Nicholas she said full still:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1145" id="noteref-1145" epub:type="noteref">1145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now peace, and thou shalt laugh anon thy fill.”]</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon down set him on his knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “I am a lord at all degrees:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For after this I hope there cometh more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leman, thy grace, and, sweetë bird, thine ore.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1146" id="noteref-1146" epub:type="noteref">1146</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The window she undid, and that in haste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Have done,” quoth she, “come off, and speed thee fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest that our neighëbours should thee espy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Absolon gan wipe his mouth full dry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark was the night as pitch or as the coal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the window she put out her hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon him fell ne bet ne werse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1147" id="noteref-1147" epub:type="noteref">1147</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with his mouth he kiss’d her naked erse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full savourly. When he was ware of this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aback he start, and thought it was amiss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he wist a woman hath no beard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He felt a thing all rough, and long y-hair’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë; “Fy, alas! what have I do?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Te he!” quoth she, and clapt the window to;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon went forth at sorry pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A beard, a beard,” said Hendy Nicholas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God’s corpus, this game went fair and well.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This silly Absolon heard every deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1148" id="noteref-1148" epub:type="noteref">1148</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his lip he gan for anger bite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to himself he said, “I shall thee quite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1149" id="noteref-1149" epub:type="noteref">1149</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who rubbeth now, who frotteth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1150" id="noteref-1150" epub:type="noteref">1150</a> now his lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With dust, with sand, with straw, with cloth, with chips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Absolon? that saith full oft, “Alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My soul betake I unto Sathanas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But me were lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1151" id="noteref-1151" epub:type="noteref">1151</a> than all this town,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Of this despite awroken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1152" id="noteref-1152" epub:type="noteref">1152</a> for to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! alas! that I have been y-blent.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1153" id="noteref-1153" epub:type="noteref">1153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hotë love is cold, and all y-quent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1154" id="noteref-1154" epub:type="noteref">1154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For from that time that he had kiss’d her erse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of paramours he settë not a kers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1155" id="noteref-1155" epub:type="noteref">1155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was healed of his malady;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full often paramours he gan defy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weep as doth a child that hath been beat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A softë pace he went over the street</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a smith, men callen Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1156" id="noteref-1156" epub:type="noteref">1156</a> Gerveis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his forgë smithed plough-harnéss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sharped share and culter busily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon knocked all easily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Undo, Gerveis, and that anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, who art thou?” “It is I, Absolon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What? Absolon, what? Christë’s sweetë tree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1157" id="noteref-1157" epub:type="noteref">1157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why rise so rath?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1158" id="noteref-1158" epub:type="noteref">1158</a> hey! <i xml:lang="la">benedicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth you? some gay girl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1159" id="noteref-1159" epub:type="noteref">1159</a> God it wote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath brought you thus upon the virëtote:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1160" id="noteref-1160" epub:type="noteref">1160</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Saint Neot, ye wot well what I mean.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Absolon he raughtë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1161" id="noteref-1161" epub:type="noteref">1161</a> not a bean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all his play; no word again he gaf,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1162" id="noteref-1162" epub:type="noteref">1162</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had morë tow on his distaff<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1163" id="noteref-1163" epub:type="noteref">1163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than Gerveis knew, and saidë; “Friend so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hotë culter in the chimney here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend it to me, I have therewith to don:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1164" id="noteref-1164" epub:type="noteref">1164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will it bring again to thee full soon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gerveis answered; “Certes, were it gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in a pokë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1165" id="noteref-1165" epub:type="noteref">1165</a> nobles all untold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shouldst it have, as I am a true smith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hey! Christë’s foot, what will ye do therewith?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thereof,” quoth Absolon, “be as be may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall well tell it thee another day:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught the culter by the coldë stele.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1166" id="noteref-1166" epub:type="noteref">1166</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full soft out at the door he gan to steal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went unto the carpentérë’s wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He coughed first, and knocked therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the window, light as he did ere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1167" id="noteref-1167" epub:type="noteref">1167</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Alison answered; “Who is there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That knocketh so? I warrant him a thief.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, nay,” quoth he, “God wot, my sweetë lefe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1168" id="noteref-1168" epub:type="noteref">1168</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thine Absolon, my own darling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold,” quoth he, “I have thee brought a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mother gave it me, so God me save!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fine it is, and thereto well y-grave:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1169" id="noteref-1169" epub:type="noteref">1169</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This will I give to thee, if thou me kiss.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Nicholas was risen up to piss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought he would amenden all the jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1170" id="noteref-1170" epub:type="noteref">1170</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shouldë kiss his erse ere that he scape:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up the window did he hastily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out his erse he put full privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the buttock, to the haunchë bone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewith spake this clerk, this Absolon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Speak, sweetë bird, I know not where thou art.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Nicholas anon let fly a fart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As great as it had been a thunder dent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1171" id="noteref-1171" epub:type="noteref">1171</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with the stroke he was well nigh y-blent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1172" id="noteref-1172" epub:type="noteref">1172</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was ready with his iron hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Nicholas amid the erse he smote.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Off went the skin an handbreadth all about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hotë culter burned so his tout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1173" id="noteref-1173" epub:type="noteref">1173</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for the smart he weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1174" id="noteref-1174" epub:type="noteref">1174</a> he would die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1175" id="noteref-1175" epub:type="noteref">1175</a> for woe he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Help! water, water, help for Goddë’s heart!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This carpenter out of his slumber start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard one cry “Water,” as he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1176" id="noteref-1176" epub:type="noteref">1176</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “Alas! now cometh Noë’s flood.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sat him up withoutë wordës mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his axe he smote the cord in two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down went all; he found neither to sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor bread nor ale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1177" id="noteref-1177" epub:type="noteref">1177</a> till he came to the sell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1178" id="noteref-1178" epub:type="noteref">1178</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the floor, and there in swoon he lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up started Alison and Nicholay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cried out an “harow!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1179" id="noteref-1179" epub:type="noteref">1179</a> in the street.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The neighbours allë, bothë small and great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rannë, for to gauren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1180" id="noteref-1180" epub:type="noteref">1180</a> on this man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That yet in swoonë lay, both pale and wan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with the fall he broken had his arm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But stand he must unto his owen harm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when he spake, he was anon borne down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Hendy Nicholas and Alisoún.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They told to every man that he was wood;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1181" id="noteref-1181" epub:type="noteref">1181</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was aghastë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1182" id="noteref-1182" epub:type="noteref">1182</a> so of Noë’s flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through phantasy, that of his vanity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had y-bought him kneading-tubbës three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had them hanged in the roof above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that he prayed them for Goddë’s love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sitten in the roof for company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk gan laughen at his phantasy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the roof they kyken,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1183" id="noteref-1183" epub:type="noteref">1183</a> and they gape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turned all his harm into a jape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1184" id="noteref-1184" epub:type="noteref">1184</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whatsoe’er this carpenter answér’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was for nought, no man his reason heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With oathës great he was so sworn adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was holden wood in all the town.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every clerk anon right held with other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They said, “The man was wood, my levë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1185" id="noteref-1185" epub:type="noteref">1185</a> brother;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every wight gan laughen at his strife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus swived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1186" id="noteref-1186" epub:type="noteref">1186</a> was the carpentérë’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his keeping<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1187" id="noteref-1187" epub:type="noteref">1187</a> and his jealousy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Absolon hath kiss’d her nether eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Nicholas is scalded in the tout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This tale is done, and God save all the rout.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1188" id="noteref-1188" epub:type="noteref">1188</a></span>
